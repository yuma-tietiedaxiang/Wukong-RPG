In this game, you step into the shoes of one of the legendary characters from the classic Chinese novel "Journey to the West" (Xi You Ji). The story revolves around a group of travelers on a quest to retrieve sacred Buddhist texts. You can choose to play as one of the four main characters:

* **Monkey King (Sun Wukong)**: A rebellious and powerful monkey with incredible strength and magical abilities.

* **Pigsy (Zhu Bajie)**: A half-man, half-pig creature known for his appetite and strength.

* **Sandy (Sha Wujing)**: A calm and reliable river ogre with great strength.

* **Tang Monk (Tang Sanzang)**: A human monk tasked with retrieving the sacred texts, protected by his disciples.

Your mission is to defend the village from waves of invading monsters (demons), grow stronger by acquiring weapons and armor, and ultimately defeat all the monsters to bring peace to the land.
