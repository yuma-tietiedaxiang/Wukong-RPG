 * A player has the ability to fight, move, and take damage like other combat objects in the game,

 *
 * The {@link IPlayer} interface adds a new method {@code getGold()} to retrieve the amount of gold

 * for various in-game transactions like buying items or healing.
 *
 * This interface can be implemented by various player character classes, allowing for different
 * player types with potentially different combat abilities and resource management strategies.
 *
 * The game engine can utilize this interface to manage the playerâ€™s interactions, combat behavior,
 * and resource management in a consistent manner.
